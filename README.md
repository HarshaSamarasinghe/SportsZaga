 🏀 SportsZaga - MERN Stack Online Sports Equipment Management System

**SportsZaga** is a full-stack web application developed as part of my Year 2 Semester 2 project. Built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this system aims to streamline the management of sports equipment in an online environment.

### 🔧 Key Features:

* 🏷️ **Inventory Management** – Track and manage available sports equipment.
* 📦 **Renting Management** – Users can rent sports items, while admins can approve or reject rental requests.
* 🔧 **Repair Management** – Record and monitor the repair status of damaged equipment.
* 🎨 **Customization Requests** – Users can request custom sports gear (e.g., name printing, color changes).
* 🌟 **Review System** – Users can add reviews and ratings for items.
* 🛡️ **Admin Dashboard** – Admins have full control over user requests, including rentals, repairs, and customizations.

> ✅ **My Contribution:**
> I was responsible for implementing the **Renting Management Module**, including request creation, admin approval/rejection, item availability tracking, and return status updates.
